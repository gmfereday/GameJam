#The Hoard
##Ideation
During the ideation process I tried to come up with everything I could think of that correlated with "spreading". The ideas I came up with were:
- Virus (Zombie)
- Butter
- Jam
- Disco Fever
- Power
- Influence

##Culling
During the culling phase I determined that the easiest idea to work with given the time frame was the Zombie Virus. I decided on a top down zombie survival game where the objective is to kill as many zombies as possible to reduce the spread of the zombie virus. I utilized the Simple Apocalypse assets that I purchased on HumbleBundle because they came with animations and had zombie assets and weapons.
